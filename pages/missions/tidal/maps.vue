                    <p class="font-medium">This was a custom landing page I built for Latinx Heritage Month.  Project managers wanted something visually interesting and engaging that would also highlight the content they were creating for the in-app campaign.  We landed on a concept that, along with a stylized essay in the header, would include an interactive map of the Latin countries we were including in the campaign.  The map would let the users select a specific country and it would automatically scroll to the designated playlist of that country.</p>

                    <p class="font-medium">This was a custom landing page I built for the World Cup campaign we ran in 2018.  The content team had created a set of playlists for each participating countryâ€™s team, which would be highlighted on a landing page as well as in-app.  The landing page allowed users to select a country, which then auto-scrolled down to a section where the playlist would appear. </p>
